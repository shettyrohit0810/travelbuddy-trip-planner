"""Points of interest from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API.

Chosen as the default POI source because it needs **no API key and no account**, so a
fresh clone of this repo produces real, grounded itineraries out of the box rather than
the empty-results path. OpenTripMap remains supported when a key is configured (see
`destination_search`), but nothing depends on one existing.

Two honest limitations drive the design here, and both are worth reading before
trusting any number this module produces:

1. **OSM has no ratings.** There is no user-rating field to map onto the 0-5 scale the
   scheduler's knapsack maximises. Rather than invent one, `_notability_score` derives a
   coarse proxy from whether a feature is linked to Wikidata/Wikipedia -- a reasonable
   stand-in for "is this a landmark or a bus shelter", but explicitly NOT a quality
   rating, and it should never be presented to a user as one.

2. **Cost data is usually missing.** The `fee` tag is absent on most features. Treating
   absent-as-free would let unpriced attractions be selected as zero-cost against a
   tight budget -- exactly the class of bug the Hypothesis property test already caught
   once in the knapsack. So absence is treated as "probably costs something" and falls
   back to the category rate estimate. Only an explicit `fee=no` yields 0.0.

    A single `out center N` truncates the union arbitrarily (Overpass emits nodes
    before ways, and a city like Kyoto has thousands of minor `historic` nodes). That
    crowded every famous landmark out of the results: an early version of this query
    returned six obscure municipal museums for Kyoto and not one of Kinkaku-ji,
    Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizu-dera or Nijō Castle -- all of which are ways, and all of
    which sat below the cut.

    The `tourism` key filter excludes accommodation values explicitly. A key-only
    `["tourism"]` match also catches `tourism=hotel`, which put "ANA Crowne Plaza Kyoto"
    and "Mitsui Garden Hotel" into a sightseeing list on the first working run.

    Requiring a `wikidata` link is what makes this both fast and good. It is the
    difference between scanning every tagged feature in a dense city and scanning only
    the ones editors cross-referenced to an encyclopedia entry -- which is almost
    exactly the set a traveller would recognise. `out center` gives areas (most large
    sites are ways, not points) a usable coordinate.

`node`/`way` are named explicitly rather than using the `nwr` shorthand, and there
    is no unfiltered fill pass. Three earlier versions timed out server-side: one swept
    every `historic` feature in the radius, one used `nwr` (which drags relations into
    an already-expensive tag scan), and one added an unfiltered tourism pass. Overpass
    signals these as **HTTP 200 with a `remark` field**, not an error status, so a
    too-expensive query is easy to misread as "this city has no attractions".

    Even so this is not fast: measured at roughly 60-85s cold for Kyoto. That is why
    results are cached for 24h per location -- the cost is paid once per city, and
    steady-state lookups are effectively free.
